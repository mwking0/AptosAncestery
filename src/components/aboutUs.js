              <li>Built on the innovative and highly efficient Aptos blockchain, our app offers a secure, transparent, and user-centric approach to health data management.</li>
              <li>This innovative platform leverages the Aptos blockchain to create a secure, decentralized solution for managing family health histories, genetic data, and personal medical records.</li>
              <li>It addresses two key problems: the lack of ancestral health information leading to unawareness of hereditary diseases, and the challenges faced by frequent travelers in maintaining continuous healthcare.</li>
